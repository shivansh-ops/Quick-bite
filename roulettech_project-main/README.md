# Description
This website is a demonstration platform built with a React.js frontend and a Django backend, showcasing essential features like onboarding, registration, and tracking functionalities. It includes the following pages:
* **Onboarding Page:** The onboarding page introduces new users to the website's features, providing a smooth and welcoming start.
* **Registration Page:** Users can sign up using traditional methods or via Google Sign-In, integrated through Firebase, to experience the registration process.
* **Sign-In Page:** The sign-in page allows users to log in using their credentials or Google Sign-In. Since this is a demo, token-based authentication is not implemented.
* **Login Successful Page:** Upon logging in, users are directed to a simple confirmation page that signifies a successful login.
* **Tracking Screen:** The tracking screen is a key feature of the demo, offering:
  *	A reverse countdown clock starting 2 hours ahead of the current time. For example, at 12 PM, the clock starts at 2 PM and counts down.
  * Random Quotes: The screen displays random quotes to keep users engaged while tracking time.
  * Speed Control: Users can adjust the clockâ€™s speed up to 10x using a speed range input, allowing for a customized experience.
  *	Share Button: A share button copies the current page URL, which, when opened in a new browser, will replicate the same clock speed settings.

Please note that since this is a demo, there is no token-based authentication, and protected routes are not implemented.
